### What is Support Vector Machine (SVM)?

Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a supervised machine learning algorithm that can be used for both classification and regression tasks. However, it is primarily used for classification problems. SVM works by finding the hyperplane that best divides a dataset into classes. The best hyperplane is the one that maximizes the margin between the two classes. The points that lie on the boundary of the margin are called support vectors.

### Key Concepts of SVM:

1. **Hyperplane**: A decision boundary that separates different classes in the feature space.
2. **Margin**: The distance between the hyperplane and the nearest data points from either class. SVM aims to maximize this margin.
3. **Support Vectors**: Data points that are closest to the hyperplane and influence its position and orientation.
