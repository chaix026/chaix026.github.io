## COVID-19 Cases Track 
I created this R Shiny App to help visualize and compare the COVID-19 cases and death across several major outbreak countries. The dashborad fetches data from online data courses and plots both average daily and cumulative values for confirmed cases and deaths since the first 100 confirmed cases.
