## Raster Data Analysis in R 
Do you need to pull information from remote sensed data (e.g., satellite image) to feed into your analysis? This course is designed for those who want to learn some basic geocomputation applications using raster, or pixelized, data. Through this course, you will learn how to explore image data and conduct basic transformations and analysis such as reclassification, map algebra, reprojection, cropping, mosaicing/merging, etc. You will have the opportunity to immediately practice your new skills via hands-on exercises focused on agri-food applications throughout the 2-hour workshop.
