Cluster analysis is a fundamental technique in machine learning and data mining used to group similar data points into clusters. The objective of cluster analysis is to identify inherent patterns or structures in unlabeled data. Here's a short introduction to cluster analysis:

### Algorithm Examples:

- **K-Means Clustering**: A popular partitioning algorithm that partitions data into K clusters by minimizing the within-cluster variance.
- **Hierarchical Clustering (Agglomerative and Divisive)**: Build a hierarchy of clusters by recursively merging or splitting clusters based on similarity.
- **DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise)**: Clusters data points based on density, suitable for datasets with arbitrary shapes and noise.
- **Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM)**: Model data points as samples from a mixture of several Gaussian distributions, allowing for soft clustering.
