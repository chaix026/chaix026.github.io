## About Me
Ph.D. in applied economics with 6+ years of teaching and research experience in data analysis, economic modeling, risk management, food and agricultural production, and technology impact assessment. I am a highly motivated and versatile data scientist with a unique interdisciplinary background. I am proficient in using, and taught, R (10+ years) and Python (4+ years) for economic and statistical modeling, in-depth data analysis, and innovative data visualization. I am a motivated self-learner with strong interests in applying big data and machine learning techniques to address multifaceted challenges.
